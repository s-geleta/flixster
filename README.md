### Walkthrough Video

`TODO://` Add the embedded URL code to your animated app walkthrough below, `ADD_EMBEDDED_CODE_HERE`. Make sure the video or gif actually renders and animates when viewing this README. Ensure your walkthrough showcases the presence and/or functionality of all features you implemented above (check them off as you film!). Pay attention to any **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS** checkboxes listed above to ensure graders see the full functionality of your website! (🚫 Remove this paragraph after adding walkthrough video)

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, although we didn't have as much lab worktime as usuall this week, they were helpful in getting started on the assignment. Specifically, rendering data using React and an API was a lot easier after getting experience from the labs. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would spend a little more time making the site even more interactive and user friendly by adding more features and styling details. For instance, I would continue implementing stretch features such as the sidebar. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I think my voice projection was better this time but one thing that I would like to work on for next time is being more prepared with deciding on the specific code snippets I want to showcase.

### Open-source libraries used
